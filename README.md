# Math Foundations in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental mathematical concepts, with applications to quantitative finance, data science, and decision sciences.  

The purpose is to translate theory into code and progressively build a solid foundation for future projects in econometrics, optimization, and financial engineering.  

## 🚀 Features
- Core mathematical algorithms and numerical methods
- Probability and statistics simulations
- Optimization techniques
- Well-documented Jupyter notebooks

## 🛠️ Tools
- Python 3
- NumPy, SciPy, SymPy
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 🎯 Goal
This repository is part of my learning journey in mathematics, programming, and finance. It will evolve over time as I add more implementations and examples.
